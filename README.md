# DBT Setup

1. Setup venv and activate venv
2. Install Requirements
3. Install extensions :Add to GIT Ignore, YAML, Better Jinja

**DBT-for-bigquery-set-up**

1. Set up dbt via command line: from <https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/bigquery-setup#local-oauth-gcloud-setup>
2. gcloud cli ..
2. Authenticate Big-Query - Run this line:
3.

For Mac or Linux

```
gcloud auth application-default login \
  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/iam.test

```

For Windows:

```
gcloud auth application-default login --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/iam.test
```

**CREATING A NEW DBT PROJECT**

1. Get into a new project
2. Run: "dbt init" to create a project : input a name
name: your-project-name
chose database: [1] BigQuery
chose authentication: [1] oauth
enter GCP Project name OR ID:
enter dataset name
thread: 60
select;  US

### NOTE: Always ensure you are inside the folder that has your dbt virtual environment and that your virtual environment is activated

3. Run:

```
dbt debug --config-dir
```

4. open the profiles.yaml :  >> copy the dev profiles and create a productions profile : change the schema

create new branch by clicking on main: switch to the branch >> stage the changes and commit

**Install dbt power user extension:**

1. Search for dbt power user: install
2. Run " command shift p "
3. In the tab tha shows up search for user settings.json : open it and copy the below into the json file:
Add this to the file

```

    // Associated the right file types with the right VSCode extensions
    "files.associations": {
        "*.sql": "jinja-sql"
    },

    // CRUCIAL - you need to change this to terminal.integrated.env.[osx|windows|linux] depending on your system
    // and point it to the folder where your profiles directory is stored!
    "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
        "DBT_PROFILES_DIR": "fill-this-with-the-path-to-the-folder-containing-your-profiles.yaml-file-on-your-local-file",
  "BIGQUERY_PROJECT": "fill-this-with-your-gcp-pproject-name"
   },

```

Above
 a. if you are on a mac you can add this  ```~/.dbt``` as ```DBT_PROFILES_DIR```
 b. add ```GCP-PROJECT-ID``` as  BIGQUERY_PROJECT NAME
 c. In the  ```terminal.integrated.env.osx``` tag replace "osx" with  either ```windows or linux``` depending on your system's OS

4. run "dbt clean && dbt deps"
5. Restart the vs code or run "command shift p" >> select reload window >> choose the correct python interpreter
6. check the models folder to see if the models have the dbt icon (it works successfully if it does)

**NOTE ADD thelook_ecommerce (ECOMMERCE)  DATA FROM BIGQUERY PUBLIC DATASET**

**Dbt Project Architecture: Source >> Staging >> Intermediate >> Final Table (Fact or Dimensions Table or View)**
(Staging : Usually layer of transformation)

1. Create a staging folder   inside the models folder
2. Inside the staging folder : add a src_ecommerce.yml file and file it up with all the souce description as below:

```
version: 2

sources:
  - name: thelook_ecommerce
    database: bigquery-public-data
    tables:
      - name: inventory_items
      - name: order_items
      - name: orders
      - name: products
      - name: users

```

3. Inside the same root that has the dbt_project.yml create a packages.yml and fill it up as below:

```
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 1.0.0

  - package: calogica/dbt_expectations
    version: [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"]

  - package: dbt-labs/codegen
    version: 0.9.0
```

4. Run: ``` dbt deps ```
5. Before running the next command ensure that the bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce has been pulled into your bigquery project: do this on the bigquery

6. To generate the query for the staging orders table,  Run:
 ```
 dbt run-operation  --profiles-dir /Users/abidakunabisoye/.dbt generate_base_model --args '{"source_name": "thelook_ecommerce", "table_name": "orders"}'

 ```

	or

 ```
  dbt run-operation generate_base_model --args '{"source_name": "thelook_ecommerce", "table_name": "orders"}'

 ```

7. Create a stg_ecommerce_orders.sql
8. After running the above query a query is generated : copy the query generated and paste into the stg_ecommerce_orders.sql
9. Run:
``` dbt run ``` or ``` dbt run -s stg_ecommerce_orders ```
10. Generate the yml file for the stg_ecommerce_orders model: run

  ``` dbt run-operation  generate_model_yaml  --args '{"model_names": ["stg_ecommerce_orders"]}'
  ```

  or

  ```
  dbt run-operation  --profiles-dir /Users/path-to-profiles.yaml-file/.dbt generate_model_yaml  --args '{"model_names": ["stg_ecommerce_orders"]}'
  ```

11. Crteated a stg_ecommerce_orders.yml file and paste in the result of the previous command
12. Update the table as shown below

```
